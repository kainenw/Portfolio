            <p class="desc"> This was kind of a toy project. It is far too clunky without the use of AI. I did some data mining with python to get the most used wordsThis motivational quote generator is built with Javascript, CSS and HTML. I used Python to pull and save 12,000 motivational quotes from goodreads. Then, it found the words mentioned more than 500 times and saved them to a new javascript file. It currently selects between 3 sentence structures, but I plan improve and expand them soon.</p>

            <p id="desc0" class="desc"><br><br> This project is the most difficult I have completed to date. During development, I lost significant progress more than once, which taught me some better practices when it comes to data storage. It also required an expansion of my project management skills since it was a big project, but the setbacks took a lot of momentum from me. So it took a lot of determination to actually get the project finished. This is a single page application built with React and Redux. React makes the site efficient and flexible. It uses API calls to the reddit .json API for home page, subreddit and search data. All data is centralized in one Redux store.

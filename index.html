          I'm Kainen, a Nashville-based programmer with an interest in frontend
          web development and music. You can view my work below and contact info

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past 2+ years, I have been teaching myself to code in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript and Python, using resources like MDN, codecademy, and
        w3schools. I have become familiar the essential technologies of the web,
        along with some very helpful frameworks such as React, Redux, jQuery,
        and Bootstrap. I build aesthetic, responsive, interactive and accessible
        websites and web applications.

              This project is the most difficult I have completed to date.
              During development, I lost significant progress more than once due
              to device failure, which taught me better practices when it comes
              to data storage. It also required me to improve my project
              management skills. Since it was a big project, it took a lot of
              determination to actually get the project finished. This is a
              single page application built with React and Redux. React makes
              the site efficient and flexible. It uses API calls to the reddit
              .json API for home page, subreddit and search data. All data is
              centralized in one Redux store.

              This was my first independent project with JavaScript. It was a
              learn-as-you-go experience which was much harder to implement than
              it was to design. This is a resource to jumpstart the creation of
              a savings plan. I have made this spreadsheet so many times that I
              decided to formalize it and make it accessable on the web. It is
              built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user inputs income and
              expenses, and the Javascript calculates how much remains and
              displays the result. I do have plans to make the page better by
              adding an export ability. That way you can continue with the
              spreadsheet on a program like excel or google sheets.

              This is a music theory project that allows users to experiment
              with different kinds of chord changes. The chord changes are
              visualized on a grid, the tonnetz, which is a way to graphically
              visualize chords. There are buttons for each unique chord
              transformation that is possible within a neo-riemannean
              cclassification system. It is designed with HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript. It uses the html canvas, which was a small part of the
              Tonnetz-Viz repo, which I have adapted to my own purposes here. I
              have plans to allow the user to interact directly with the grid by
              clicking on it. I will implement this with the html canvas
              framework Konva.js.

              This is project that I started in order to formalize the rules of
              counterpoint according to Johann Fux. At first, I programmed it to
              find the one possible counter-melody with the fewest leaps. After
              looking at some other projects with the same goal, I realized I
              wanted to get every possible solution, so that I could pick from
              them. I implemented this in a wildly ineficcient way, using lists
              which had to be copied and split for each note in the melody. This
              led me to rethink how to keep track of the different valid
              solutions. I am currently restructuring the data so that the
              different possibilies can be represented in a graph, with each
              node on the graph corresponding to one possibity in the
              counterpoint.

          <p>
            I'm Kainen, a Nashville-based programmer with an interest in
            frontend web development and music theory. Over the past two years,
            I have been teaching myself to code in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
            Python, using resources like MDN, codecademy, and w3schools. I have
            become familiar the essential technologies of the web, along with
            some very helpful frameworks such as React, Redux, jQuery, and
            Bootstrap.I build aesthetic, responsive, interactive and accessible
            websites and web applications. If you would like to work together,
            feel free to

                This project is the most difficult I have completed to date.
                During development, I lost significant progress more than once
                due to device failure, which taught me better practices when it
                comes to data storage. It also required me to improve my project
                management skills. Since it was a big project, it took a lot of
                determination to actually get the project finished. This is a
                single page application built with React and Redux. React makes
                the site efficient and flexible. It uses API calls to the reddit
                .json API for home page, subreddit and search data. All data is
                centralized in one Redux store.

                This was my first independent project with JavaScript. It was a
                learn-as-you-go experience which was much harder to implement
                than it was to design. This is a resource to jumpstart the
                creation of a savings plan. I have made this spreadsheet so many
                times that I decided to formalize it and make it accessable on
                the web. It is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The user
                inputs income and expenses, and the Javascript calculates how
                much remains and displays the result. I do have plans to make
                the page better by adding an export ability. That way you can
                continue with the spreadsheet on a program like excel or google
                sheets.

                This is a music theory project that allows users to experiment
                with different kinds of chord changes. The chord changes are
                visualized on a grid, the tonnetz, which is a way to graphically
                visualize chords. There are buttons for each unique chord
                transformation that is possible within a neo-riemannean
                cclassification system. It is designed with HTML, CSS, and
                Javascript. It uses the html canvas, which was a small part of
                the Tonnetz-Viz repo, which I have adapted to my own purposes
                here. I have plans to allow the user to interact directly with
                the grid by clicking on it. I will implement this with the html
                canvas framework Konva.js.

                This is project that I started in order to formalize the rules
                of counterpoint according to Johann Fux. At first, I programmed
                it to find the one possible counter-melody with the fewest
                leaps. After looking at some other projects with the same goal,
                I realized I wanted to get every possible solution, so that I
                could pick from them. I implemented this in a wildly ineficcient
                way, using lists which had to be copied and split for each note
                in the melody. This led me to rethink how to keep track of the
                different valid solutions. I am currently restructuring the data
                so that the different possibilies can be represented in a graph,
                with each node on the graph corresponding to one possibity in
                the counterpoint.
